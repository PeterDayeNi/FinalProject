# Killing Bubbles 2.0

This is a upgrade version of the killing bubbles game that I made for midterm mini project.

## Summary

Basic on the killing bubbles game that I made for midterm mini project, the following are the upgrade that I would like to make:

1.Create more bullets and keep shooting all the time.

2.Made the bubbles move softly.

3.Remake the timer.

4.Make the game look better.

5.Simplify the code.

I will keep working on JavaScript on P5.

## Component Parts

Most of my steps are mentioned above. Here are some details information of each step.

1.Using a for loop to create more bullets(about 20), and using the “distance” to decide when the bubbles are killed 

2.Using the ball move we learnt in the earlier this semester.

3.Using real time to calculate the time that player have.

4.Just made it look better.

5.Simplify the code including, for example, using for loop instead of put all numbers up.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1: re-work from the killing the bubbles 1.0
- Week 2: fixed all the basic functions, shooting, bubbles moving
- Week 3: background story
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

Still having trouble in using for loop and group
